Prb(r|eports)				Prb(e|ports)
Probability(reports) / Probability(eports)		= Probability(eports) / Probability(ports)
= probability(backward_trie, "eports", "reports")	= probability(backward_trie, "ports", "eports"
from word "reports" cut off first letter

Prf(t|repor) 
= Probability(report) / Probability(repor)
= probability(forward_trie, "repor", "report")

Prf(e|correspond) < 1
= Probability(corresponde) / Probability(correspond)
= probability(forward_trie, "correspond", "corresponde")
